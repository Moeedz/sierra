Call in your Higher Self and set the intention for what you’re ready to awaken or receive. </p><p>The jewelry will attune to your energy and begin working with you immediately, amplifying the frequencies your soul is ready to embody.</p><p>In the future, I’ll be offering guided activations to help you take this connection even deeper. </p>"

            "answer": "<p></p><p>My favorite ways to cleanse your jewelry are with<strong> sunlight</strong>, <strong>sound frequency</strong>, and <strong>pure intention</strong>. </p><p>These methods help reset and recharge the energy so it can fully align with you again. </p><p>You can place your piece in the sun for a few minutes, play healing tones or sound bowls nearby, or simply hold it in your hands and set the intention to clear and renew its energy.</p><p> I’ll be sharing a more in-depth cleansing guide on my Instagram for you to follow along with. </p>"

            "answer": "<p></p><p>When a piece breaks, it’s often more than physical, it can symbolize the completion of a cycle or the release of energy that’s no longer needed. </p><p>You can choose to keep the stones for future work, or reach out to me to see if it can be repaired. </p><p>Every piece carries its own journey with you, and sometimes, breaking simply means its purpose has been fulfilled.</p>"
