            "answer": "<p></p><p>“Light-Coded” is a term I use to describe the high vibrations and energetic activation codes infused into every piece.</p><p>Each creation is a living frequency—a bridge between your physical self and your Higher Self. </p><p>Through crystal allies, color frequencies, and sacred intention, these pieces awaken the wisdom within you, helping you remember who you are, why you’re here, and guiding you back into full alignment with your soul’s purpose.</p>"

            "answer": "<p></p><p>Yes! Each piece is an energetic anchor designed to support deeper states of awakening, healing, and remembrance. </p><p>When you consciously connect with your Light-Coded jewelry during meditation or astral travel, you open a direct channel to your Higher Self—allowing you to receive clear guidance, activations, and experiences.</p>"

            "answer": "<p></p><p>My favorite ways to cleanse your jewelry are with<strong> sunlight</strong>, <strong>sound frequency</strong>, and <strong>pure intention</strong>. </p><p>These methods help reset and recharge the energy so it can fully align with you again. </p><p>You can place your piece in the sun for a few minutes, play healing tones or sound bowls nearby, or simply hold it in your hands and set the intention to clear and renew its energy.</p><p> I’ll be sharing a more in-depth cleansing guide on my Instagram for you to follow along with. </p>"

            "question": "How can I activate my jewelry?",
            "answer": "<p></p><p>Activation begins with intention.</p><p>When you first receive your piece, take a moment to connect—hold it in your hands, close your eyes, and breathe. Call in your Higher Self and set the intention for what you’re ready to awaken or receive. </p><p>The jewelry will attune to your energy and begin working with you immediately, amplifying the frequencies your soul is ready to embody.</p><p>In the future, I’ll be offering guided activations to help you take this connection even deeper. </p>"

            "question": "What happens if my jewelry breaks?",
            "answer": "<p></p><p>When a piece breaks, it’s often more than physical, it can symbolize the completion of a cycle or the release of energy that’s no longer needed. </p><p>You can choose to keep the stones for future work, or reach out to me to see if it can be repaired. </p><p>Every piece carries its own journey with you, and sometimes, breaking simply means its purpose has been fulfilled.</p>"
